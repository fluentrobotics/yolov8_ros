# YOLOv8 ROS Integration

This repository contains Python modules and a dependency specification to use
Ultralytics YOLOv8 with ROS 2. Additional documentation about how this
repository is organized can be found in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- ROS 2 Humble
- Python 3.10
  - Included with Ubuntu 22.04
  - For other supported Ubuntu LTS distributions, the [Deadsnakes Ubuntu
    PPA][deadsnakes] provides the required `python3.10 python3.10-distutils
    python3.10-venv` packages.
- The [Poetry][poetry-docs] dependency manager
- A CUDA 11.8.x runtime environment

### Install dependencies to a virtual environment

This repository uses Poetry to install dependencies to a virtual environment.
The virtual environment is located at the top level of this repository
regardless of the next command used to initialize it.

If you are developing outside of a ROS 2 workspace, run `poetry install
--no-root` within this repository.

This repository is set up to build with `colcon` using the `ament_cmake`
backend. If this repository is inside a ROS 2 workspace, run `colcon build` from
the top level of the ROS 2 workspace.

### (Optional) Run YOLO Checks

After the virtual environment is initialized, you can run YOLO status checks
using `poetry run yolo check`. You should see output similar to below:

```shell
$ poetry run yolo check

### Running ROS Nodes

All ROS nodes are Python modules that must run within the virtual environment.
There are multiple ways to run ROS nodes depending on context.

#### Launch Files

If this repository is inside a ROS 2 workspace, use the following commands at
the top level of the workspace.

```shell
source install/setup.$(basename $SHELL)

# Replace LAUNCH_FILE_NAME with one of the files in launch/
ros2 launch yolov8_ros LAUNCH_FILE_NAME
```

#### Direct Invocation

Running nodes directly with Python may be useful for development and testing.
Use the following commands from the top level of this repository.

```shell
# Activate the virtual environment
poetry shell

# Run the node as a Python module, e.g.,
python3 -m yolov8_ros.right_wrist_node
```
